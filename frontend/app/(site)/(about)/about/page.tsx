          <p>
            In a major disaster the first reports rarely come from official channels. They come from neighbours, volunteers and
            passers-by — on WhatsApp, on radio, by word of mouth — and they arrive scattered, duplicated and often after the
            network has already failed. Meanwhile, spontaneous volunteers turn up at relief camps with skills nobody has time to
            match to the work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Volentify brings those threads together. The <strong>web platform</strong> gives incident commanders a live map of
            hazards, missions, responders, hospitals and shelters. <strong>Volentify Mesh</strong>, a companion Android app,
            lets volunteers file structured reports with no signal at all and relay them phone to phone until one reaches the
            internet. A set of <strong>forecasting and triage models</strong> estimates storm surge, reads distress messages in
            Indian languages and corroborates reports across sources. The <strong>dispatch engine</strong> then sends the right
            person to each mission, protecting scarce specialists from generic work.
          </p>
          <h2>Who it is for</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Volunteers</strong> — register skills and equipment once, see missions near you, report from the field offline.</li>
            <li><strong>Citizens</strong> — district alerts, priority evacuation for households with infants, elderly or medical dependencies.</li>
            <li><strong>NGOs</strong> — publish relief quotas and fleet assets, request volunteers, coordinate with command.</li>
            <li><strong>Incident command</strong> — broadcast alerts, review field reports, run dispatch and read situation briefings.</li>
            <li><strong>Researchers</strong> — analytical access to evidence and forecasts.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Open source</h2>
